Mortality ICU Project 2022

Summer 2022 data science projects from the ASU Data Science Unit at Hayden.  This project was from a competition to find the highest accuracy in identifying 
adult ICU patients as "survived" / "non survived".  Features were extracted from HIPAA compliant EHR data with comorbidity information as well as other EHR data.  
Summer challenge: Experiment with tuning and model selection to get comparable or better accruacy metrics than the model authored by ASU data scientist, 
Little.  

My original code is indicated in the header of the python notebooks.  Any notebooks or files not labeled as such are original work of David Little.
